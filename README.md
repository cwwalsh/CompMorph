# CompMorph
2nd Year Computational Morphology assignment.

This repository is intended to provide an example of a Computational Morphology project for CSL seocond years, using xfst and lexc.

Rather than being an introduction to the tools involved, I intended it to be an example of a complete project, which I don't remember seeing a lot of.

This particular project is an FST implementation of the Perfekt and Prateritum tenses of German. It is not totally accurate as I know there is some minor issues with some of the vowel replacement rules.
